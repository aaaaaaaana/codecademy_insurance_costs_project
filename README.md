# codecademy_insurance_costs_project
This exploratory data analysis looks at correlations between different person characteristics and their insurance cost.
I initially looked at the distribution of costs per age, and found that there are some pretty well-defined strata of costs.

I then looked to see if any of the given variables are the sole reason for that stratification, but I could not find a single factor that correlated with the strata.
